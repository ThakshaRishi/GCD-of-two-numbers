# Find the GCD of two numbers

## AIM:
To write a program to find the GCD of two numbers using function.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Moodle-Code Runner

## Algorithm
1. Define a function.
2. Get the two numbers from the user.
3. Use the math.gcd() function to find the gcd of the two values.
4. Print the output.

## Program:

    hcf=math.gcd(n1,n2)
    return hcf
n1,n2=int(input()),int(input())
print("GCD of two numbers is:",gcd())
```
